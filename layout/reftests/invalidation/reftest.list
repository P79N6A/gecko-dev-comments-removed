# The below test involves XUL that expects to be able to use
# Components.interfaces. This is kind of a tricky situation because reftests
# actually run XUL with file:// URIs, and flip a pref that allows remote XUL
# from the filesystem. And in fact, we have special behavior to allow access to
# the Components object on remote XUL origins. However, we actually have an
# override pref during automation that disables this behavior during automation.
# Since reftests don't have SpecialPowers, our simplest path to victory here is
# to override the override. Ugh.
