.woff files for SVG-in-OpenType testing
=======================================

There are three .woff files in this directory:
 * nosvg.woff
 * svg.woff
 * rubbish.woff

nosvg.woff
----------
This font is FiraSansOT-Regular, with its metrics hacked so that its ascent
is 1000 and descent is 0. Its unitsPerEm value is 1000.

It contains no 'SVG ' table.

svg.woff
--------
This font is the same as nosvg.woff above, but with the glyphs-*.svg SVG
documents from this directory embedded in it using the tools described below.

rubbish.woff
------------
This font is the same as nosvg.woff above, but with the addition of an 'SVG '
table with the contents of rubbish.txt. Its purpose is to test that SVG tables
without valid XML are ignored.

Creating the Fonts
------------------
The tools used here are insertsvg.py from [1] and sfnt2woff from [2].

svg.woff can be recreated with:

woff2sfnt nosvg.woff > nosvg.ttf
insertsvg.py nosvg.ttf svg.ttf glyphs-*.svg
sfnt2woff svg.ttf
