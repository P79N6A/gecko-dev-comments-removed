.woff files
===========

There are three .woff files in this directory:
 * svg.woff
 * nosvg.woff
 * rubbish.woff

nosvg.woff
----------
This font is Liberation Serif with the addition of a glyph with a UVS selector
(Liberation fonts do not come with UVS glyphs; one had to be added to test that
SVG glyphs work with UVS selectors). It contains no 'SVG ' table.

svg.woff
--------
This font is the same as nosvg.woff above, but with the glyphs-*.svg SVG
documents from this directory embedded in it using the tools described below.

The tools used here are insertsvg.py from [1] and sfnt2woff from [2].

svg.woff can be recreated with:

woff2sfnt nosvg.woff > nosvg.ttf
insertsvg.py nosvg.ttf svg.ttf glyphs-*.svg
sfnt2woff svg.ttf

rubbish.woff
------------
This font is the same as nosvg.woff above, but with the addition of an 'SVG '
table with the contents of rubbish.txt. Its purpose is to test that SVG tables
without valid XML are ignored.

A tool for creating the rubbish font can also be found at [1]; named
`insertrubbish.py`. rubbish.woff can be created with:

woff2sfnt nosvg.woff > nosvg.ttf
insertsvg.py nosvg.ttf rubbish.ttf rubbish.txt
sfnt2woff rubbish.ttf
