/**
 * nsIBrowserGlue is a dirty and rather fluid interface to host shared utility 
 * methods used by browser UI code, but which are not local to a browser window.
 * The component implementing this interface is meant to be a singleton
 * (service) and should progressively replace some of the shared "glue" code 
 * scattered in browser/base/content (e.g. bits of utilOverlay.js, 
 * contentAreaUtils.js, globalOverlay.js, browser.js), avoiding dynamic 
 * inclusion and initialization of a ton of JS code for *each* window.
 * Dued to its nature and origin, this interface won't probably be the most
 * elegant or stable in the mozilla codebase, but its aim is rather pragmatic:
 * 1) reducing the performance overhead which affects browser window load;
 * 2) allow global hooks (e.g. startup and shutdown observers) which survive
 * browser windows to accomplish browser-related activities, such as shutdown
 * sanitization (see bug #284086)
 *
