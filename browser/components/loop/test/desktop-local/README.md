== Mocha unit tests ==

These unit tests use the browser build of the [Mocha test framework][1]
and the Chai Assertion Library's [BDD interface][2].

[2]: http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/

Aim your browser at the index.html in this directory on your localhost using a file: or HTTP URL to run the tests.

Next steps:
* hook up to Marionette test suite so that they can be run by Tbpl
* run via mach command-line
* run using JS http server so the property security context for DOM elements is used
