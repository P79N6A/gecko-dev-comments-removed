# We have three category of browser-chrome tests:
#  global: these tests focus on the global PB service implementation.
#  perwindow: these tests focus on the per-window PB implementation.
#  obsolete: these tests focus on the global mode, but the functionality
#            that they are testing is specific to the global mode, and
#            will never have a per-window counterpart.
#
# As a transition plan, we have divided the existing tests into the
# global and obsolete categories, and we'll then focus on rewriting the
# global tests to test the per-window mode.
