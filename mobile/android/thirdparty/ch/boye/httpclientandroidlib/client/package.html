The API for client-side HTTP communication.
<p/>
The usual execution flow can be demonstrated by the
code snippet below:

<PRE>
HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();

// Prepare a request object
HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet("http://www.apache.org/");

// Execute the request
HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httpget);

// Examine the response status
System.out.println(response.getStatusLine());

// Get hold of the response entity
HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();

// If the response does not enclose an entity, there is no need
// to worry about connection release
if (entity != null) {
    InputStream instream = entity.getContent();
    try {

        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(instream));
        // do something useful with the response
        System.out.println(reader.readLine());

    } catch (IOException ex) {

        // In case of an IOException the connection will be released
        // back to the connection manager automatically
        throw ex;

    } catch (RuntimeException ex) {

        // In case of an unexpected exception you may want to abort
        // the HTTP request in order to shut down the underlying
        // connection and release it back to the connection manager.
        httpget.abort();
        throw ex;

    } finally {

        // Closing the input stream will trigger connection release
        instream.close();

    }
}

</PRE>
