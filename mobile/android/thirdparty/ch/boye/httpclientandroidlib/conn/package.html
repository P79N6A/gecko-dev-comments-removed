The client-side connection management and handling API that provides interfaces
and implementations for opening and managing client side HTTP connections.
<p>
The lowest layer of connection handling is comprised of
{@link org.apache.http.conn.OperatedClientConnection OperatedClientConnection}
and
{@link org.apache.http.conn.ClientConnectionOperator ClientConnectionOperator}.
The connection interface extends the core
{@link org.apache.http.HttpClientConnection HttpClientConnection}
by operations to set and update a socket. An operator encapsulates the logic to
open and layer sockets, typically using a
{@link org.apache.http.conn.scheme.SocketFactory}. The socket factory for
a protocol {@link org.apache.http.conn.scheme.Scheme} such as "http" or "https"
can be looked up in a {@link org.apache.http.conn.scheme.SchemeRegistry}.
Applications without a need for sophisticated connection management can use
this layer directly.
</p>
<p>
On top of that lies the connection management layer. A
{@link org.apache.http.conn.ClientConnectionManager} internally manages
operated connections, but hands out instances of
{@link org.apache.http.conn.ManagedClientConnection}.
This interface abstracts from the underlying socket operations and
provides convenient methods for opening and updating sockets in order
to establish a {@link org.apache.http.conn.routing.HttpRoute route}.
The operator is encapsulated by the connection manager and called
automatically.
</p>
<p>
Connections obtained from a manager have to be returned after use.
This can be {@link org.apache.http.conn.ConnectionReleaseTrigger triggered}
on various levels, either by releasing the
{@link org.apache.http.conn.ManagedClientConnection connection} directly,
or by calling a method on
an {@link org.apache.http.conn.BasicManagedEntity entity} received from
the connection, or by closing the
{@link org.apache.http.conn.EofSensorInputStream stream} from which
that entity is being read.
</p>
<p>
Connection managers will try to keep returned connections alive in
order to re-use them for subsequent requests along the same route.
The managed connection interface and all triggers for connection release
provide methods to enable or disable this behavior.
