# Don't use the jemalloc allocator on Android, because we can't guarantee
# that Gecko will configure sqlite before it is first used (bug 730495).
#
# Don't use the jemalloc allocator when using system sqlite. Linked in libraries
# (such as NSS) might trigger an initialization of sqlite and allocation
# of memory using the default allocator, prior to the storage service
# registering its allocator, causing memory management failures (bug 938730).
#
# Note: On Windows our sqlite build assumes we use jemalloc.  If you disable
# MOZ_STORAGE_MEMORY on Windows, you will also need to change the "ifdef
# MOZ_MEMORY" options in db/sqlite3/src/Makefile.in.
