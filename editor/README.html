HTML (i.e. Composer) and plaintext editor<p>

The editor directory contains C++ interfaces, C++ code, and XUL/Javascript
for the embeddable editor component, which is used for the HTML Editor
("Composer"), for plain and html mail compose, and for text fields and
text areas throughout the product.
<p>
The editor is designed like a "browser window with editing features": it
adds some special classes for editing text and managing transaction
undo/redo, but reuses browser code for nearly everything else.
