=======================
Firefox Services Module
=======================

The ``/services`` directory contains code for a variety of application
features that communicate with external services - hence its name.

It was originally created to hold code for Firefox Sync. Later, it
became the location for code written by the Mozilla Services Client team
and thus includes Firefox Health Report. This team no longer exists, but
the directory remains.
