  <h1>Conformance test for the Media Capture and Streams API</h1>
  <p>This page contains a foundation of conformance tests that can be expanded
  to cover most things in the W3C specification of the Media Capture and Streams
  API.</p>
  <p>VERSION: These tests are based on the W3C Editor's Draft of August 24th,
  2013
  (<a href="http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20130824/getusermedia.html">http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20130824/getusermedia.html</a>)
  <p>STATUS: In its current state, it only performs simple checks on the various
  attributes and methods of the objects exposed by the API. There's not much
  functionality tested so far. The spec doesn't define if an attribute shall be
  owned by the object itself (<code>assert_own_propety</code>) or if it shall be
  inherited (<code>assert_inherits</code>). Since testharness.js doesn't offer
  any generic function that covers both, the method for verification is
  currently chosen according to the current Chrome implementation.</p>
  <p>PREFIXES: These tests currently utilizes the <code>adapter.js</code>
  script, which handle the prefixes used by different browsers.</p>
  <p>HOW TO RUN: The easiest way is to tell your browser to:
  <ul>
  <li>Provide a fake webcam (<code>--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream</code> in
  Chrome)</li>
  <li>Automatically allow access to the webcam
  (<code>--use-fake-device-for-media-stream</code> in Chrome)</li>
  <li>Allow loading HTML files from disk
  (<code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code> in Chrome)</li>
  </ul>
  Then just load this HTML file to execute the tests.</p>
