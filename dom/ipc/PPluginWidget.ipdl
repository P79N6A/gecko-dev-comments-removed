 * from content.  On the content side there's PluginWidgetProxy which
 * implements nsIWidget. We hand this around layout and plugins code. Anything
 * not dealt with via PluginWidgetProxy falls through to PuppetWidget. Native
 * widget exists on the chrome side (PluginWidgetParent) attached to the
 * browser window as a child. Window management calls are forwarded from
 * PluginWidgetProxy to PluginWidgetParent over this interface.
 *
 * Note lifetime management for PluginWidgetProxy (the plugin widget) and the
 * connection (PluginWidgetChild) are separated. PluginWidgetChild will
 * be torn down first by the tab, followed by the deref'ing of the nsIWidget
 * via layout.
