   The Tp test measures page load times in Firefox.  It does this with a
   JavaScript script that opens a new window and cycles through page loads
   from the local disk, timing each one.  The script dumps the sum of the
   mean times to open each page, and the standard deviation, to standard out.
   We can also measure performance attributes during the test.  See below for
   what can be monitored
