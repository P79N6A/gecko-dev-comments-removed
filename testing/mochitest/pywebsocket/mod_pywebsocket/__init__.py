"""Web Socket extension for Apache HTTP Server.

mod_pywebsocket is a Web Socket extension for Apache HTTP Server
intended for testing or experimental purposes. mod_python is required.

Installation:

0. Prepare an Apache HTTP Server for which mod_python is enabled.

1. Specify the following Apache HTTP Server directives to suit your
   configuration.

   If mod_pywebsocket is not in the Python path, specify the following.
   <websock_lib> is the directory where mod_pywebsocket is installed.

       PythonPath "sys.path+['<websock_lib>']"

   Always specify the following. <websock_handlers> is the directory where
   user-written Web Socket handlers are placed.

       PythonOption mod_pywebsocket.handler_root <websock_handlers>
       PythonHeaderParserHandler mod_pywebsocket.headerparserhandler

   To limit the search for Web Socket handlers to a directory <scan_dir>
   under <websock_handlers>, configure as follows:

       PythonOption mod_pywebsocket.handler_scan <scan_dir>

   <scan_dir> is useful in saving scan time when <websock_handlers>
   contains many non-Web Socket handler files.

   If you want to support old handshake based on
   draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-75:

       PythonOption mod_pywebsocket.allow_draft75 On


   Example snippet of httpd.conf:
   (mod_pywebsocket is in /websock_lib, Web Socket handlers are in
   /websock_handlers, port is 80 for ws, 443 for wss.)

       <IfModule python_module>
         PythonPath "sys.path+['/websock_lib']"
         PythonOption mod_pywebsocket.handler_root /websock_handlers
         PythonHeaderParserHandler mod_pywebsocket.headerparserhandler
       </IfModule>

Writing Web Socket handlers:

When a Web Socket request comes in, the resource name
specified in the handshake is considered as if it is a file path under
<websock_handlers> and the handler defined in
<websock_handlers>/<resource_name>_wsh.py is invoked.

For example, if the resource name is /example/chat, the handler defined in
<websock_handlers>/example/chat_wsh.py is invoked.

A Web Socket handler is composed of the following two functions:

    web_socket_do_extra_handshake(request)
    web_socket_transfer_data(request)

where:
    request: mod_python request.

web_socket_do_extra_handshake is called during the handshake after the
headers are successfully parsed and Web Socket properties (ws_location,
ws_origin, ws_protocol, and ws_resource) are added to request. A handler
can reject the request by raising an exception.

web_socket_transfer_data is called after the handshake completed
successfully. A handler can receive/send messages from/to the client
using request. mod_pywebsocket.msgutil module provides utilities
for data transfer.

A Web Socket handler must be thread-safe if the server (Apache or
standalone.py) is configured to use threads.
