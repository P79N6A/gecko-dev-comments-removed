# Build section covers the -b[uild] and -p[latform] options that try provides.
builds:
  # The format for registering a new build flag -> task looks like this:
  #
  # <flag name>
  #   # Platforms are primarily used to restrict test runs to only X platform
  #   # but the information is stored on the build to indicate which platform(s)
  #   # the build belongs to. Note that `platforms` here is the term used by the
  #   # try chooser meaning "some group of tests" examples of platforms are
  #   # things like "b2g", "win32"
  #   platforms:
  #     - <platform name>
  #   # note that for sanity o -> means opt and d -> means debug if additional
  #   # flags are passed we will attempt to match them up to an option here if
  #   # available
  #   types:
  #     opt: <path to opt task>
  #     debug: <path to debug task>
