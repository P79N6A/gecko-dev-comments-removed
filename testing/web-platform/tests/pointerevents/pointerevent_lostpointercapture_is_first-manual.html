        <h1>Pointer Events capture test - lostpointercapture order</h1>
        <h4>
            Test Description:
            This test checks if lostpointercapture is handled asynchronously and prior to all subsequent events.
            Complete the folowing actions:
            <ol>
                <li>Press and hold left mouse button over "Set Capture" button. "gotpointercapture" should be logged inside of the black rectangle
                <li>"lostpointercapture" should be logged inside of the black rectangle after a short delay
            </ol>
        </h4>
        Test passes if lostpointercapture is dispatched after releasing the mouse button and before any additional pointer events.
